# This service takes an URI to an alpha mask to block logo or such

# What to look for - The returned segments in SMIL are footage with the following removed
# dark-quiet =  remove segments that are dark and quiet
# dark = remove dark (based on threshold)
# quiet = remove quiet

# The approximate load placed on the node while running signal detection
#Each job uses ffmpeg to examine the audio track for silence and/or darkness
#These are somewhat expensive operations, so their load should be medium
# Default: 0.2
